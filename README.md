# revcheck
This script checks if common programs have been altered in any way (netcat, bash, perl, and python). 
It compares their hashes, file sizes, and permissions to known good versions. If anything seems off, it will flag it as a potential backdoor or modification. The goal is to help you quickly spot security risks.
